/*

There are mainly two types of data types are there in js

1) Primitive Data Types

- Stored directly in the location the variable access.
- Stored in stack

example:

In js there are 6 primitive types

String
Number
Boolean
Null      //Intentional empty value
Undefined
Symbols(ES6)

2) Reference type

- Accessed by reference
- Objects that are stored on the heap
- A pointer to a location in memory

example:

Arrays
Object Literals
Functions
Dates 
Anything Else...


ðŸ”¶ JS is a dynamically typed language

- Types are associated with values not variables
- The same variable can hold multiple types
- We do not need to specify types 
- Most other languages are statically typed(Java, C#, C++)
- There are supersets of JS and addons to allow static typing
(Typescript, Flow)
