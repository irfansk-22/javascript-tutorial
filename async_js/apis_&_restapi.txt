ðŸ”¸ What is An API(Application Programming Interface)?

1) Similar to how UIs help people use programs, APIs 
help programs interact with other programs. APIs are
tools that computers use to communicate with one 
another, in part to send and receive data.

2) There's all kinds of APIs.
We're specifically talking about Web APIs, but there's 
also APIs in your computer and your operating system 
and your smartphone, even some refrigerators.

There's many, many devices that have different types 
of APIs. So this is very generalized, but it's 
essentially a contract provided by one piece of 
software to another,and it usually consists of a 
structured request in a structured response.


ðŸ”¸ REST API's

1) Representational State Transfer
2) Architecture style for designing networked applications
3) Relies on a stateless, client-server protocol, almost 
always HTTP
4) Treats server objects as resources that can be created
or destroyed
5) Can be used by virtually any programming language
6) All API's have their own rules and structure


ðŸ”¸ HTTP Requests

- GET: Retrieve data from a specified resource
- POST: Submit data to be processed to a specified resource
- PUT: Update a specified resource
- DELETE: Delete a specified resource

HEAD: Same as GET but does not return a body
OPTIONS: Returns the supported HTTP method
PATCH: Update partial resources


ðŸ”¸ API Endpoints

When you have some kind of API, whether it's your own 
or whether it's an external API, you're going to have 
something called endpoints and endpoints of the URL's 
that we access to do certain things.

GET    https://someurl.com/api/users   //Get all users
GET    https://someurl.com/api/users/1 //Get single user
POST   https://someurl.com/api/users   //Add user
PUT    https://someurl.com/api/users/1 //Update user
DELETE https://someurl.com/api/users   //Delete user
